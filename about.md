In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey caused massive flooding in Southeast
Texas, USA. The storm left a number of residents stranded and in need of
rescue. Emergency first responders were overwhelmed with the high volume
of rescue calls. A loose-knit group of volunteer boaters assisted in the
rescue effort. These volunteers explored neighborhoods seeking out
residents who needed assistance. In addition, with the support of social
media, a group of volunteers served as dispatchers to relay rescue
requests to the volunteer boaters. This group of volunteers became known
as the [**Cajun Navy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy). The
Cajun Navy has been operating in various forms since Hurricane Katrina
in 2005.

## The Solution

The Emergency Response Demo application is inspired by the Cajun Navy
response from Hurricane Harvey. It provides an online solution to
connect stranded residents with volunteer responders. This application
makes it easy to engage the community to organize volunteer
responders.

| Incident  | A request for help from an individual (or group of individuals) that are in need of rescue. Details of an Incident include the location (Lat, Long), the number of people stranded and whether medical assistance is required.                                                                                           |
| Responder | A volunteer who has a boat and is willing to rescue people who have reported an Incident. The boat has a capacity and a flag is set if they can/cannot provide first aid. There are two types of responders. People who sign up online via the emergency console and simulated responders via the Responder Simulator.   |
| Mission   | When a Responder is assigned an Incident, a Mission is created. The Mission defines where the Responder needs to go to collect the victims of the Incident (the Way Point) and what shelter the victims should be dropped off at (the Target Location). The mission also has details of the responders location history. |
