The emergency response demo is a collection of microservices and an effort done across multiple teams to put out a reference demo, that entails an event driven architecture with the most commonly used runtimes for Cloud Native Development. 


Often as an architect or a developer you wonder how can I get started creating a microservices and distributed architecture. How can I build up on logic that resides in the form of rules e.g. Process Automation and connect it with the rest of my services. or How could I observe these services and build them faster with a platform such as Openshift or 
Kubernetes. 
  
As an architect you might wonder how could I put together all the awesomeness from a Red Hat stack together, what to  use, and how to use. This demo tries to answer those questions. It puts together some of the key capabilites. Automation, Integration and Runtimes.

Let's not forget, this is only one way of expressing how you can architect an application environment. There are many other ways to solve problems. This one of course has the flavour for an Event driven and reactive architecture. 
  
Check out the [Install guide](/install.md) and the [Getting Started guide](/gettingstarted.md) to dig in.
