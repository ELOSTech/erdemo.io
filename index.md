The Emergency Response application is a reference demo of a collection of microservices created across multiple teams.
It entails an event driven architecture with the most commonly used runtimes for Cloud Native Development, Agile Integration and Business Automation.


Often as an architect or a developer you wonder how you can get started creating a microservice and distributed architecture application.  For example, how can you build up on logic that resides in the form of rules e.g. Process Automation and connect it with the rest of your services ?  Or how can you observe these services and build them faster with a platform such as [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform) ?  As an architect you might wonder how you could put together all the awesomeness from a Red Hat stack together, what to  use, and how to use it. 
The Emergency Response application answers many of these questions. 

Using a real-world use-case (Evacutation of citizens by fellow community members in a disaster area), the Emergency Response application is implemented using key capabilites from the Red Hat product portfolio: *Business Automation*, *Integration* and *Runtimes* all running in hybrid-cloud environment powered by OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Let's not forget, this is only one way of expressing how you can architect an application environment. There are many other ways to solve problems. This one of course has the flavor for an Event driven and reactive architecture. 
  
Check out the [Install guide](/install.md) and the [Getting Started guide](/gettingstarted.md) to dig in.
