The Emergency Response application is a reference demo that showcases the [Power of Communities](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/16623/398059 ).
In particular, it clarifies how the accelerating pace of open-source innovation can be harnessed today in a supported, enterprise manner for your line of business in a hybrid-cloud environment.  Mission critical applications that your business relies on can be built and run on open-source innovation *TODAY*.

The theme for the Emergency Response demo application is inspired by the [volunteer community collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy) that occured in 2017 during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  A simlar community-driven, collaborative approach was used to develop the demo application and maintain it going forward.

For those that are architects, developers and IT operation managers of mission-critical business workloads , the Emergency Response demo application is a treasure chest of technical insight and best practices.  It entails a micro-service, event driven architecture using the products that comprise Red Hat's [Unified Application Environment](https://developers.redhat.com/appenv).  It is deployed to and scales horizontally on the premier hybrid cloud platform for enterprise business workloads: [Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform).

Often as an architect or a developer you wonder how you can get started creating a microservice and distributed architecture application.  For example, how can you build up on logic that resides in the form of rules e.g. Process Automation and connect it with the rest of your services ?  Or how can you observe these services and build them faster with a platform such as [OpenShift Container Platform](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform) ?  As an architect you might wonder how you could put together all the awesomeness from a Red Hat stack together, what to  use, and how to use it. 
The Emergency Response application answers many of these questions. 

Using a real-world use-case (Evacuatation of citizens by fellow community members in a disaster area), the Emergency Response application is implemented using key capabilites from the Red Hat product portfolio: *Business Automation*, *Integration* and *Runtimes* all running in hybrid-cloud environment powered by OpenShift and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
  


Let's not forget, this is only one way of expressing how you can architect an application environment. There are many other ways to solve problems. This one of course has the flavor for an Event driven and reactive architecture.
