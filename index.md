The Emergency Response application is a reference demo that showcases the [Power of Communities]( https://youtu.be/rVtsGZIFw4s ).
In particular, it clarifies how the accelerating pace of open-source innovation can be harnessed today in a supported, enterprise manner for your line of business in a hybrid-cloud environment.  Mission critical applications that your business relies on can be built and run on open-source innovation *TODAY*.

The theme for the Emergency Response demo application is inspired by the [volunteer community collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Navy) that occurred in 2017 during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.  A similar community-driven, collaborative approach was used to develop the demo application and maintain it going forward.

For those that are architects, developers and IT operation managers of mission-critical business workloads , the Emergency Response demo application is a treasure chest of technical insight and best practices.  It entails a micro-service, event driven architecture using the products that comprise Red Hat's [Unified Application Environment](https://developers.redhat.com/appenv).
